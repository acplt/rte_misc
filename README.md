# ACPLT/RTE miscellaneous libraries

This repository is part of the ACPLT/OV runtime environment (RTE).
It provides miscellaneous additional OV libraries.
For compiling and using these libraries, the APLT/RTE core project is required: https://github.com/acplt/rte

This Git repository is designed as a "library project", which can included as a subdirectory into an application specific OV project (e.g. as a Git submodule).
See OV's readme file for more information about recommended project structures: https://github.com/acplt/rte#project-structure


## Included OV libraries

* `MessageSys` – function block types for message-based communication via ACPLT/KS
* `services` – generic object class for services (as in Service-based Architecture)
